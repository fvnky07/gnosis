# gnosis

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Next.js, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **React Native** - Build mobile apps using React
- **Expo** - Tools for React Native development
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Husky** - Git hooks for code quality
- **Tauri** - Build native desktop applications
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
Use the Expo Go app to run the mobile application.

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@gnosis/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Initialize hooks: `bun run prepare`
- Format and lint fix: `bun run check`

## Available Scripts

- `bun run dev`: Start all applications in development mode
- `bun run build`: Build all applications
- `bun run dev:web`: Start only the web application
- `bun run check-types`: Check TypeScript types across all apps
- `bun run dev:native`: Start the React Native/Expo development server
- `bun run check`: Run Biome formatting and linting
- `cd apps/web && bun run desktop:dev`: Start Tauri desktop app in development
- `cd apps/web && bun run desktop:build`: Build Tauri desktop app
- Note: Desktop builds package static web assets. Next.js needs a static/export build configuration before desktop packaging will work.
